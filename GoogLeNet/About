This work include 2 parts. 

One(model_t, model.train) is based on the given dataset, which is same as the former works including AlexNet and LeNet, 

while the other(model_testdatadiy, model_traindatadiy) is based on the dataset built by ourselves.

I also wrote some scripts including "mean_std.py" and "data_partitioning.py" 

in order to make some work concerning data preprocessing when using the dataset built by ourselves.
